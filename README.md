# :ant: antreminder [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tolusalako/antreminder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tolusalako/antreminder) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tolusalako/antreminder/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/tolusalako/antreminder?branch=master)
When will that class be open? I'm pretty sure a lot of us have asked that question before. This is my attempt to answer it. __Antreminder__ notifies you when a class's status has changed to __OPEN__ | __WAITLIST__ | __NEWONLY__ | __FULL__.



Inspired by [AntPlanner](https://github.com/gumho/antplanner2). Would have forked, but I was on a java-high.
